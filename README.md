# Julia Key Agreement (JKA) Tamarin Model

We modeled the Julia key agreement protocol presented in the paper (doi: https://doi.org/10.1145/3448300.3468116) using the formal verification tool Tamarin prover.

* The folder JKA_1. contains the tamarin models of JKA protocol with single scalar mulitplication.
* The folder JKA_2. contains the tamarin models of JKA protocol with two scalar mulitplication.

## Getting started

Download and install the Tamarin Prover.

Read the instructions of the Tamarin prover for installation, see chapter 2 of the manual: https://tamarin-prover.github.io/manual/book/002_installation.html

* Run the theory, either in interactive mode or using the command line
    * run *tamarin-prover interactive 'filename'*
    * Click *Sorry* to prove lemmas, or you can manually prove them with the available choices.
